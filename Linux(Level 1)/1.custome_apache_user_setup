# Create a user with a specific ID & Home Directory KodeKloud Engineer Task

Problem statement: For security reasons, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has decided to use custom Apache users for each web application hosted, rather than its default user. This will be the Apache user, so it shouldn't use the default home directory. Create the user as per the requirements given below:
a. Create a user named Kareem on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.
b. Set UID to 1208 and its home directory to /var/www/Kareem.

Info to perform the task:
server_name: stapp01
user: tony

You are going to perform these tasks from the "thor@jump_host /$" jumphost machine.

Solution:-
( Sub-Task 1)
-- First login to the App Server 1 and switch to the root user using the below commands 
>> ssh tony@172.16.238.10
>> Enter the password for the tony user: Ir0nM@n
>> sudo -i
>> Enter password for the tony user: Ir0nM@n
Now you are a root user under App Server 1

( Sub-Task 2)
now create a user named kareem with a custom UID as 1208 and set its home directory to the /var/www/kareem using below command (one-line command task)
>> sudo adduser -u 1208 -m -d /var/www/kareem kareem
Done...
  
Note:- You can perform sub-task 2 one by one like first create the user kareem with UID 1208 then create kareem home directory in /var/www/kareem then set kareem user's home directory to /var/www/kareem.
